## How to make tea

First, if you're reading this, you're a damn fool. Now, let's proceed.

### Prerequisites:

1. A mug/cup.
2. Some sort of tea.
3. Potable water.
4. Appliances to boil the water, including a electric kettle/kettle/pan/pot with a hook and a long stick, a cooking panel/fireplace/wood, and electricity/matches/lighter/erupting volcano. And a tea strainer.

### Making tea

In this instruction, I'll focus on a conventional way to make tea. All other cases will be described in future updates if any.

#### The most convenient way

To make a wonderful, hot cup a' tea (whatever it may mean in any local dialect/slang to you, it's just a damn good cup a' tea to sip):

1. Whip out a cup. Of course, it's your favorite one.
2. Put a tea strainer over it. Of course, it fits! It's your favorite cup and strainer.
3. Take a good pinch of any sort of tea, just enough to make a good cup a' tea. I'm joking, not any — your favorite one.
4. Drop the tea into the strainer.
5. Take a kettle. Open the lid if you didn't lose it yet.
6. Pour some potable water into the kettle. Just enough to make you happy... and a good cup a' tea.
7. Fire up a ring on your cooking panel and put the kettle onto it. Of course, they match! It's your kettle and your cooking panel — you chose them. ;-)
8. Wait till the kettle starts singing and then another 1-2 minutes for the water to boil properly.
9. Switch off the ring and let the kettle sit there for 3-5 minutes for the water to lose 10-20 degrees Celsius. That'll preserve more vitamins in the tea. You use Fahrenheit over Celsius? Here's an [online calculator](https://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/fahrenheit-to-celsius.htm).
10. Pour the water over the strainer, into the cup.
11. Decide how strong you want your tea and wait enough time for it to get ready. Generally, it's from 1 to 10 minutes.
    Earth minutes if you're an alien. IDK, ask around what "Earth minutes" are. Don't scare anybody away or you're risking getting into Area 51 and I don't think they serve tea there.
12. Take the strainer away and enjoy your tea. Oh, here are [some biscuits](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/biscuits-1200-1-of-1.jpg) for you.


TL;DR: Just get a cup, hot boiled water, tea, tea strainer. Start making the damn tea. Successfully finish making the damn tea.
